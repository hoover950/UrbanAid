### 2. **Mobile App Updates**

#### **Enhanced Filter System** (`mobile-app/src/components/FilterModal.tsx`)
- **Organized by Category**:
  - Infrastructure (Water, Restrooms, WiFi, etc.)
  - Health Services (HRSA health centers)
  - Veterans Services (VA facilities)
  - USDA Services (Rural development, SNAP, Farm services)
  - Essential Services (Shelters, Food assistance)

#### **Updated Type Definitions** (`mobile-app/src/types/utility.ts`)
- Added 21 new utility categories for government services
- Comprehensive type safety for all data sources
- Backward compatibility maintained

#### **Enhanced API Service** (`mobile-app/src/services/apiService.ts`)
- New methods for all government data sources
- Combined search functionality
- Proper error handling and TypeScript support

## 🗺️ **Data Coverage & Geographic Scope**

### **National Coverage**
- **HRSA**: ~1,400+ health centers nationwide
- **VA**: ~1,200+ medical facilities nationwide  
- **USDA**: ~2,500+ service centers nationwide

### **Search Capabilities**
- **Radius-based search** (configurable distance)
- **State-based filtering** (all 50 states + territories)
- **Facility type filtering** (specific service types)
- **Combined government facility search**

## 📱 **User Experience Enhancements**

### **Organized Dropdown Menus**
The filter modal now groups facilities by category for better UX:

```

├── Restrooms 🚻
├── Charging Stations 🔌
└── WiFi Hotspots 📶

Health Services  
├── Health Centers 🏥
├── Community Health Centers 🏥
├── Migrant Health Centers 🚑
└── FQHCs 🏥

Veterans Services
├── VA Medical Centers 🏥
├── VA Outpatient Clinics 🏥
├── Vet Centers 🇺🇸
└── VA Regional Offices 🏛️

USDA Services
├── USDA Rural Development 🌾
├── SNAP/Food Assistance 🍽️
├── Farm Service Centers 🚜
├── Extension Offices 🎓

```

### **Rich Data Display**
Each facility includes:
- **Contact Information** (Phone, website, email)
- **Services Offered** (Specific to facility type)
- **Operating Hours** (With special notes)
- **Accessibility Features** (Wheelchair access, public transit)
- **Official Verification** (Government data sources)

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation Details**

### **Data Transformation Pipeline**
1. **Raw API Data** → Standardized format
2. **Geographic Filtering** → Distance-based results
3. **Service Mapping** → User-friendly service descriptions
4. **Accessibility Enhancement** → Comprehensive accessibility info

### **Performance Optimizations**
- **Parallel API Calls** for multiple data sources
- **Efficient Caching** strategy for government data
- **Distance Calculations** using geodesic algorithms
- **Mock Data Fallbacks** for development/testing

### **Error Handling**
- **Graceful API Failures** with fallback data
- **Network Timeout Protection**
- **Invalid Input Validation**
- **Comprehensive Logging** for debugging

## 🧪 **Testing & Verification**

### **API Endpoints Testing**
```bash
# Test HRSA Health Centers
curl "http://localhost:8000/health-centers?latitude=38.9072&longitude=-77.0369&radius_km=25"

# Test VA Facilities  
curl "http://localhost:8000/va-facilities?latitude=38.9072&longitude=-77.0369&radius_miles=50"

# Test USDA Facilities
