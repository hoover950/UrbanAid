# Icon Flickering Fix Summary

## Problem Solved
Fixed the icon flickering issue where map markers were not displaying the correct icons consistently for each utility type (wifi, restrooms, charging stations, etc.).

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Inconsistent Icon Mapping**: Multiple components had different icon mappings with missing utility types
2. **Hardcoded Icons**: App.tsx was using hardcoded `utility.icon` values instead of type-based mapping
3. **Re-rendering Issues**: Markers were re-rendering unnecessarily causing flicker
4. **Missing Anti-Flicker Properties**: Markers lacked proper `tracksViewChanges={false}` settings

## Changes Made

### 1. Comprehensive Icon Mapping (`src/utils/utilityHelpers.ts`)
- ✅ Added complete icon mapping for ALL utility types
- ✅ Consistent emojis for each service:
  - 🚻 Restrooms
  - 📶 Wi-Fi
  - 🔌 Charging Stations  
  - 💧 Water Fountains
  - 🏠 Shelters
  - 🍽️ Food Services
  - 🏥 Medical Clinics
  - And 20+ more utility types

### 2. Updated Components
- ✅ **PerformanceMarker**: Now uses centralized icon mapping
- ✅ **UtilityMarker**: Updated to use consistent mapping
- ✅ **App.tsx**: Replaced hardcoded icons with proper PerformanceMarker component

### 3. Anti-Flickering Measures
- ✅ Set `tracksViewChanges={false}` on all markers
- ✅ Added stable anchor points and center offsets
- ✅ Removed shadow effects that could cause flicker
- ✅ Implemented proper component memoization

## Result
- ✅ **Consistent Icons**: Each utility type now displays its correct, specific icon
- ✅ **No Flickering**: Icons remain stable during map interactions and state changes
- ✅ **Better Performance**: Reduced re-renders through optimized component structure
- ✅ **Accurate Mapping**: Public wifi shows 📶, restrooms show 🚻, etc.
